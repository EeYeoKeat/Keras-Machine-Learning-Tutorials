## Special notes for myself:
<ol>
<li>Why export data from xlsx format into csv format? </li>
<p> The CSV files are faster and also consumes less memory whereas Excel consumes more memory while importing data. CSV files are commonly used for data exchange between platforms, making the data “raw” again so it can be processed by different applications. This is the most flexible data format. XLSX is the file extension for a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet. </p>
