## Model used:
<ul>
<li>Linear Regression pure math - <b>Accuracy 78.71%</b></li>
<li>Linear Regression from math scratch with TensorFlow 2 - <b>Accuracy</b></li>
<li>Linear Regression using dense TensorFlow 2 - <b>Accuracy 86.42%</b></li>
<li>Linear Regression using Scikit-Learn</li>
<li>Decision Tree</li>
<li>Random Forest</li>
<li>Neural Networks - <b>Accuracy 88.57%</b></li>
</ul>


## Steps:

1) Gather a training data.
2) Preprocess


## Special notes for myself:
<ol>
<li>Why export data from xlsx format into csv format? </li>
<p> The CSV files are faster and also consumes less memory whereas Excel consumes more memory while importing data. CSV files are commonly used for data exchange between platforms, making the data “raw” again so it can be processed by different applications. This is the most flexible data format. XLSX is the file extension for a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet. </p>

1) ANN is use to predict the best erbium concentration for density and molar volume parameter towards fiber optics application.



The best is Erbium 0.05, because it has high density and larger compactness. However, the result of molar volume is giving the best when the erbium is 0.01.


1) Come out model that can predict erbium concentration based on the features.
2) Maybe clustering?
