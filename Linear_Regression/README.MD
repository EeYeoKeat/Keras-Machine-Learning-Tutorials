# Linear Regression

Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables.

Linear regression is also consider as next step up after correlation. It is function to predict the dependent value of the output variable based on the value of another independent variable. Multiple regression is situation where involve two or more independent variables.
 


## Possible way to train linear regression model:
1) Normal Equation
2) Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
3) Gradient Descent Methods

## Regularized Linear Model
1) Ridge Regression
Penalize sum of squared coefficients (L2 penalty) or sum of squared residuals.

2) Lasso Regression
Penalize sum of absolute values (L1 penalty)

3) Elastic Net
Elastic Net is combined the regularization of ridge regression and lasso.
