# Machine Learning



As a general recall about neural network in machine learning, neural networks is a series of algorithm that mimic human biological neural network. It consists of a set of connected nodes or called neuron and trained by gradient descent. The weights in each layer begin with random values, and these are iteratively improved over time to make the network more accurate. A loss function is used to quantify how inaccurate the network is, and a procedure called backpropagation is used to determine whether each weight should be increased, or decreased, to reduce the loss.

# TensorFlow

Thanks to TensorFlow and Google Brain team!

<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> help to make developer and engineer's life easier by providing comprehensive machine learning algorithm toolkits and libraries with simple APIs. For example, we do not need to build the optimizer part from scratch since TensorFlow has many built-in optimizer functions for us to call with just one simple line code.


## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.

The most widely used learning algorithms are:

<ul>
<li>Support Vector Machines</li>
<li>Linear Regression</li>
<li>Logistic Regression</li>
<li>Naive Bayes</li>
<li>Linear Discriminant Analysis</li>
<li>Decision Trees</li>
<li>K-nearest Neighbor Algorithm</li>
<li>Neural Networks (Multilayer perceptron)</li>
<li>Similarity Learning</li>
</ul>
