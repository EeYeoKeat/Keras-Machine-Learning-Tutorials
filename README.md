## Machine Learning Neural Network



As a general recall about neural network in machine learning, neural networks is a series of algorithm that mimic human biological neural network. It consists of a set of connected nodes or called neuron and trained by gradient descent. The weights in each layer begin with random values, and these are iteratively improved over time to make the network more accurate. A loss function is used to quantify how inaccurate the network is, and a procedure called backpropagation is used to determine whether each weight should be increased, or decreased, to reduce the loss.

# TensorFlow

Thanks to TensorFlow and Google Brain team!

<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> help to make developer and engineer's life easier by providing comprehensive machine learning algorithm toolkits and libraries with simple APIs. For example, we do not need to build the optimizer part from scratch since TensorFlow has many built-in optimizer functions for us to call with just one simple line code.
